## 🔐 Overview

Quantum-Resilient Topological Encryption (QRE) is a novel encryption paradigm designed to withstand attacks from advanced quantum computers. It integrates **topological quantum states** with a dynamic, evolving cryptographic layer — forming a system that not only resists quantum attacks, but thrives within a quantum-aware security landscape.

> **QRE** encodes data into geometric, non-local features of quantum matter, leveraging **braided anyons** and **entropy-adaptive mutation** to provide robust, post-quantum defense.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Topological Encoding Layer (TEL):**  
  Simulates the braid-based behavior of anyonic qubits to encode cryptographic keys into fault-tolerant, topologically stable logic.

- **Quantum Horizon Layer (QHL):**  
  A self-evolving cryptographic environment that mutates key formats and encryption logic over time, rendering attacks ineffective through unpredictability and quantum entropy feedback.
