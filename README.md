# Quantum-Resilient Topological Encryption (QRE)

## 📜 Summary
This repository contains the whitepaper and development roadmap for **Quantum-Resilient Topological Encryption (QRE)** — a novel cryptographic framework designed to resist current and future quantum computing threats.

QRE leverages the intrinsic properties of **topological quantum states** and integrates an adaptive, entropy-driven encryption layer called the **Quantum Horizon Layer**. Together, these components form a new kind of encryption architecture fundamentally different from classical post-quantum cryptography.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Topological Encoding Layer (TEL):** Encodes information using braid-based representations inspired by non-abelian anyons and topological quantum logic.
- **Quantum Horizon Layer (QHL):** A dynamic encryption shell that mutates structure, entropy, and format in real time to prevent attack modeling or pattern analysis.

---

## 🔐 Why QRE?

- Resistant to Shor’s and Grover’s quantum algorithms.
- Immune to localized quantum simulations due to non-local topological encoding.
- Evolves over time — making the encryption surface unpredictable and quantum-hostile.
